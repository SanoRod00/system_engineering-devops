# 0x01-shell_permissions

This directory contains shell scripts that cover basic Linux permissions and user management tasks, such as switching users, managing file ownership and permissions, and working with user groups.

Each script is named according to the task number and description, for example:
- `0-iam_betty`: Switches the current user to betty
- `1-who_am_i`: Prints the current effective username
- `2-groups`: Lists all groups the current user belongs to
- `3-new_owner`: Changes the owner of a file to betty
- and so on...

This directory is part of the `system_engineering-devops` repository, focusing on Linux shell permissions.
